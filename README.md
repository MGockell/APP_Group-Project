# APP_Group-Project
A repository for our group project in advanced python programming.
This game "CatchMe" was developed by Constantin Preuss-Neudorf, Maximilian Gokell, Nicole Vollmer, Stephanie Caloz, and Friedrich Finken.
We have the game class, the object class that inherits to ball and danger, and the main class that starts the game.
