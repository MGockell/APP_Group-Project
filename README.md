# APP_Group-Project
A repository for our group project in advanced python programming.
This game "CatchMe" was developed by Constantin Preuss-Neudorf, Maximilian Gokell, Nicole Vollmer and Stephanie Caloz.
We have the game class, the object class that inherits to ball and danger, and the main class that starts the game.
